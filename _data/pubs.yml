  abstract: "Generating high-quality motion plans for multiple robot
            arms is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the
            system and the potential for inter-arm collisions.
            Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions
            that are suboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution
            time for multi-arm systems. Post-processing via
            shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality
            for efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm
            scenarios, optimizing one arm's motion must not introduce
            collisions with other arms. Although existing multi-arm
            planning works often use some form of shortcutting
            techniques, their exact methodology and impact on
            performance are often vaguely described. In this work, we
            present a comprehensive study quantitatively comparing
            existing shortcutting methods for multi-arm trajectories
            across diverse simulated scenarios. We carefully analyze
            the pros and cons of each shortcutting method and propose
            two simple strategies for combining these methods to
            achieve the best performance-runtime tradeoff. Video, code,

  abstract: "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves finding
              collision-free paths for multiple agents while minimizing a
              cost function—an NP-hard problem. Bounded suboptimal
              methods like Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) and
              Explicit Estimation CBS (EECBS) balance solution quality
              with computational efficiency using focal search
              mechanisms. While effective, traditional focal search faces
              a limitation: the lower bound (LB) value determining which
              nodes enter the FOCAL list often increases slowly in early
              search stages, resulting in a constrained search space that
              delays finding valid solutions. In this paper, we propose a
              novel bounded suboptimal algorithm, double-ECBS (DECBS), to
              address this issue by first determining the maximum LB
              value and then employing a best-first search guided by this
              LB to find a collision-free path. Experimental results
              demonstrate that DECBS outperforms ECBS in most test cases
              and is compatible with existing optimization techniques.
              DECBS can reduce nearly 30% high-level Constraint Tree (CT)
              nodes and 50% low-level focal search nodes. When agent
              density is moderate to high, DECBS achieves a 23.5% average
              runtime improvement over ECBS with identical suboptimality
              bounds and optimizations."

            collision-free paths for multiple robots, is crucial for
            applications ranging from aerial swarms to warehouse
            automation. Solving MAPF is NP-hard so learning-based
            approaches for MAPF have gained attention, particularly
            those leveraging deep neural networks. Nonetheless, despite

  abstract: "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) aims to arrange collision-free goal-reaching paths for a group of agents. Anytime MAPF solvers based on large neighborhood search (LNS) have gained prominence recently due to their flexibility and scalability, leading to a surge of methods, especially those leveraging machine learning, to enhance neighborhood selection. However, several pitfalls exist and hinder a comprehensive evaluation of these new methods, which mainly include: 1) Lower than actual or incorrect baseline performance; 2) Lack of a unified evaluation setting and criterion; 3) Lack of a codebase or executable model for supervised learning methods. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified evaluation framework, implement prior methods, and conduct an extensive comparison of prominent methods. Our evaluation reveals that rule-based heuristics serve as strong baselines, while current learning-based methods show no clear advantage on time efficiency or improvement capacity. Our extensive analysis also opens up new research opportunities for improving MAPF-LNS, such as targeting high-delayed agents, applying contextual algorithms, optimizing replan order and neighborhood size, where machine learning can potentially be integrated."

  abstract: "The vast majority of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) methods with completeness guarantees require planning full-horizon paths. However, planning full-horizon paths can take too long and be impractical in real-world applications. Instead, real-time planning and execution, which only allows the planner a finite amount of time before executing and replanning, is more practical for real-world multi-agent systems. Several methods utilize real-time planning schemes but none are provably complete, which leads to livelock or deadlock. Our main contribution is Real-Time LaCAM, the first Real-Time MAPF method with provable completeness guarantees. We do this by leveraging LaCAM in an incremental fashion. Our results show how we can iteratively plan for congested environments with a cutoff time of milliseconds while still maintaining the same success rate as full-horizon LaCAM. We also show how it can be used with a single-step learned MAPF policy."

  abstract: "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a set of collision-free paths, one for each agent in a shared environment. Its objective is to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent is defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location. Explicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for bounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a user-specified factor w away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and a lower bound LB on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of paths whose SOC is at most w times LB and introduces constraints to resolve collisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its optimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding a path with cost at most its threshold, defined as w times its lower bound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up EECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to relax the requirement that each path needs to be at most its threshold. Though EECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution, increasing the thresholds may increase the SOC beyond w times LB, forcing EECBS to switch among different sets of paths (whose SOC are still at most w times LB), and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue, we propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion to the number of collisions. We also estimate the extra travel time (i.e., delays) needed to satisfy constraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we propose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical framework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is complete and bounded-suboptimal. The experiments show that our approaches outperform the original (greedy) flex distribution. Also, we redesign Focal-A* search from the previous work to improve LB for a congested environment."

  abstract: "Compared to a single-robot workstation, a multi-robot system offers several advantages: 
            1) it expands the system’s workspace, 2) improves task efficiency, and, more importantly,
            3) enables robots to achieve significantly more complex and dexterous tasks, such as cooperative assembly. 
            However, coordinating the tasks and motions of multiple robots is challenging
            due to issues, e.g., system uncertainty, task efficiency, algorithm scalability, and safety concerns. 
            To address these challenges, this paper studies multi-robot coordination and proposes APEX-MR,
            an asynchronous planning and execution framework designed
            to safely and efficiently coordinate multiple robots to achieve cooperative assembly, e.g., LEGO assembly. 
            In particular, APEX-MR provides a systematic approach to post-process multi-robot
            tasks and motion plans to enable robust asynchronous execution under uncertainty. 
            Experimental results demonstrate that APEX-MR can significantly speed up 
            the execution time of many long-horizon LEGO assembly tasks by 48% compared to sequential
            planning and 36% compared to synchronous planning on average. 
            To further demonstrate performance, we deploy APEX-MR in a dual-arm system to perform physical LEGO assembly.
            To our knowledge, this is the first robotic system capable of performing customized LEGO assembly using commercial LEGO bricks. 
            The experimental results demonstrate that the dual-arm system, with APEX-MR, 
            can safely coordinate robot motions, efficiently collaborate, and construct complex LEGO structures."

  abstract: "Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding (LMAPF) repeatedly finds collision-free paths for multiple agents that are continually assigned new goals when they reach current ones. Recently, this field has embraced learning-based methods, which reactively generate single-step actions based on individual local observations. However, it is still challenging for them to match the performance of the best search-based algorithms, especially in large-scale settings. This work proposes an imitation-learning-based LMAPF solver that introduces a novel communication module as well as systematic single-step collision resolution and global guidance techniques. Our proposed solver, Scalable Imitation Learning for LMAPF (SILLM), inherits the fast reasoning speed of learning-based methods and the high solution quality of search-based methods with the help of modern GPUs. Across six large-scale maps with up to 10,000 agents and varying obstacle structures, SILLM surpasses the best learning- and search-based baselines, achieving average throughput improvements of 137.7% and 16.0%, respectively. Furthermore, SILLM also beats the winning solution of the 2023 League of Robot Runners, an international LMAPF competition. Finally, we validated SILLM with 10 real robots and 100 virtual robots in a mock warehouse environment."

  abstract: "Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques -- generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics environments.

  abstract: "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) focuses on planning collision-free paths for multiple agents. However, during the execution of a MAPF plan, agents may encounter unexpected delays, which can lead to inefficiencies, deadlocks, or even collisions. To address these issues, the Switchable Temporal Plan Graph provides a framework for finding an acyclic Temporal Plan Graph with the minimum execution cost under delays, ensuring deadlock- and collision-free execution. Unfortunately, existing optimal algorithms, such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Graph-Based Switchable Edge Search (GSES), are often too slow for practical use. This paper introduces Improved GSES, which significantly accelerates GSES through four speedup techniques: stronger admissible heuristics, edge grouping, prioritized branching, and incremental implementation. Experiments conducted on four different map types with varying numbers of agents demonstrate that Improved GSES consistently achieves over twice the success rate of GSES and delivers up to a 30-fold speedup on instances where both methods successfully find solutions."

Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) focuses on moving multiple agents from their starts to goals without collisions. Its lifelong variant, LMAPF, continuously assigns new goals to agents. In this work, we focus on improving the solution quality of PIBT, a state-of-the-art rule-based LMAPF algorithm, by optimizing a policy to generate adaptive guidance. We design two pipelines to incorporate guidance in PIBT in two different ways. We demonstrate the superiority of the optimized policy over both static guidance and human-designed policies. Additionally, we explore scenarios where task distribution changes over time, a challenging yet common situation in real-world applications that is rarely explored in the literature.

  abstract: "Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) finds various applications in fields such as traffic management, airport operations, and warehouse automation. In many of these environments, differential drive robots are commonly used. These robots have a kinodynamic model that allows only in-place rotation and movement along their current orientation, subject to speed and acceleration limits. However, existing Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)-based methods often use simplified models for robot kinodynamics, which limits their practicality and realism. In this paper, we introduce a three-level framework called MASS to address these challenges. MASS combines MAPF-based methods with our proposed stationary state search planner to generate high-quality kinodynamically-feasible plans. We further extend MASS using an adaptive window mechanism to address the lifelong MAMP problem. Empirically, we tested our methods on the single-shot grid map domain and the lifelong warehouse domain. Our method shows up to 400% improvements in terms of throughput compared to existing methods."

  abstract: We study how to use guidance to improve the throughput of lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). Previous studies have demonstrated that, while incorporating guidance, such as highways, can accelerate MAPF algorithms, this often results in a trade-off with solution quality. In addition, how to generate good guidance automatically remains largely unexplored, with current methods falling short of surpassing manually designed ones. In this work, we introduce the guidance graph as a versatile representation of guidance for lifelong MAPF, framing Guidance Graph Optimization as the task of optimizing its edge weights. We present two GGO algorithms to automatically generate guidance for arbitrary lifelong MAPF algorithms and maps. The first method directly optimizes edge weights, while the second method optimizes an update model capable of generating edge weights. Empirically, we show that (1) our guidance graphs improve the throughput of three representative lifelong MAPF algorithms in eight benchmark maps, and (2) our update model can generate guidance graphs for as large as $93 \times 91$ maps and as many as 3,000 agents.

  abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves determining paths for multiple agents to travel simultaneously through a shared area toward particular goal locations. This problem is computationally complex, especially when dealing with large numbers of agents, as is common in realistic applications like autonomous vehicle coordination. Finding an optimal solution is often computationally infeasible, making the use of approximate algorithms essential. Adding to the complexity, agents might act in a self-interested and strategic way, possibly misrepresenting their goals to the MAPF algorithm if it benefits them. Although the field of mechanism design offers tools to align incentives, using these tools without careful consideration can fail when only having access to approximately optimal outcomes. Since approximations are crucial for scalable MAPF algorithms, this poses a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce the problem of scalable mechanism design for MAPF and propose three strategyproof mechanisms, two of which even use approximate MAPF algorithms. We test our mechanisms on realistic MAPF domains with problem sizes ranging from dozens to hundreds of agents. Our findings indicate that they improve welfare beyond a simple baseline.

  abstract: "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of moving multiple agents from starts to goals without collisions. Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) extends MAPF by continuously assigning new goals to agents. We present our winning approach to the 2023 League of Robot Runners LMAPF competition, which leads us to several interesting research challenges and future directions. In this paper, we outline three main research challenges. The first challenge is to search for high-quality LMAPF solutions within a limited planning time (e.g., 1s per step) for a large number of agents (e.g., 10,000) or extremely high agent density (e.g., 97.7%). We present future directions such as developing more competitive rule-based and anytime MAPF algorithms and parallelizing state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms. The second challenge is to alleviate congestion and the effect of myopic behaviors in LMAPF algorithms. We present future directions, such as developing moving guidance and traffic rules to reduce congestion, incorporating future prediction and real-time search, and determining the optimal agent number. The third challenge is to bridge the gaps between the LMAPF models used in the literature and real-world applications. We present future directions, such as dealing with more realistic kinodynamic models, execution uncertainty, and evolving systems."

  abstract: "Multi-Robot-Arm Motion Planning (M-RAMP) is a challenging problem featuring complex single-agent planning and multi-agent coordination. Recent advancements in extending the popular Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithm have made large strides in solving Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problems. However, fundamental challenges remain in applying CBS to M-RAMP. A core challenge is the existing reliance of the CBS framework on conservative “complete” constraints. These constraints ensure solution guarantees but often result in slow pruning of the search space – causing repeated expensive single-agent planning calls. Therefore, even though it is possible to leverage domain knowledge and design incomplete M-RAMP-specific CBS constraints to more efficiently prune the search, using these constraints would render the algorithm itself incomplete. This forces practitioners to choose between efficiency and completeness. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, Generalized ECBS, aimed at removing the burden of choice between completeness and efficiency in MAPF algorithms. Our approach enables the use of arbitrary constraints in conflict-based algorithms while preserving completeness and bounding sub-optimality. This enables practitioners to capitalize on the benefits of arbitrary constraints and opens a new space for constraint design in MAPF that has not been explored. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms,propose new “incomplete” constraints, and demonstrate their effectiveness through experiments in M-RAMP."

  abstract: "An exciting frontier in robotic manipulation is the use of multiple arms at once. However, planning concurrent motions is a challenging task using current methods. The high-dimensional composite state space renders many well-known motion planning algorithms intractable. Recently, Multi-Agent Path-Finding (MAPF) algorithms have shown promise in discrete 2D domains, providing rigorous guarantees. However, widely used conflict-based methods in MAPF assume an efficient single-agent motion planner. This poses challenges in adapting them to manipulation cases where this assumption does not hold, due to the high dimensionality of configuration spaces and the computational bottlenecks associated with collision checking. To this end, we propose an approach for accelerating conflict-based search algorithms by leveraging their repetitive and incremental nature -- making them tractable for use in complex scenarios involving multi-arm coordination in obstacle-laden environments. We show that our method preserves completeness and bounded sub-optimality guarantees, and demonstrate its practical efficacy through a set of experiments with up to 10 robotic arms."

  abstract: "Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) is a problem that seeks collision-free dynamically-feasible trajectories for multiple moving agents in a known environment while minimizing their travel time. MAMP is closely related to the well-studied Multi-Agent Path-Finding (MAPF) problem. Recently, MAPF methods have achieved great success in finding collision-free paths for a substantial number of agents. However, those methods often overlook the kinodynamic constraints of the agents, assuming instantaneous movement, which limits their practicality and realism. In this paper, we present a three-level MAPF-based planner called PSB to address the challenges posed by MAMP. PSB fully considers the kinodynamic capability of the agents and produces solutions with smooth speed profiles that can be directly executed by the controller. Empirically, we evaluate PSB within the domains of traffic intersection coordination for autonomous vehicles and obstacle-rich grid map navigation for mobile robots. PSB shows up to 49.79% improvements in solution cost compared to existing methods."

  abstract: We study the problem of generating arbitrarily large environments to improve the throughput of multi-robot systems. Prior work proposes Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms as an effective method for optimizing the environments of automated warehouses. However, these approaches optimize only relatively small environments, falling short when it comes to replicating real-world warehouse sizes. The challenge arises from the exponential increase in the search space as the environment size increases. Additionally, the previous methods have only been tested with up to 350 robots in simulations, while practical warehouses could host thousands of robots. In this paper, instead of optimizing environments, we propose to optimize Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) environment generators via QD algorithms. We train a collection of NCA generators with QD algorithms in small environments and then generate arbitrarily large environments from the generators at test time. We show that NCA environment generators maintain consistent, regularized patterns regardless of environment size, significantly enhancing the scalability of multi-robot systems in two different domains with up to 2,350 robots. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method scales a single-agent reinforcement learning policy to arbitrarily large environments with similar patterns.

  abstract: With the rapid progress in Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), researchers have studied how MAPF algorithms can be deployed to coordinate hundreds of robots in large automated warehouses. While most works try to improve the throughput of such warehouses by developing better MAPF algorithms, we focus on improving the throughput by optimizing the warehouse layout. We show that, even with state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms, commonly used human-designed layouts can lead to congestion for warehouses with large numbers of robots and thus have limited scalability. We extend existing automatic scenario generation methods to optimize warehouse layouts. Results show that our optimized warehouse layouts (1) reduce traffic congestion and thus improve throughput, (2) improve the scalability of the automated warehouses by doubling the number of robots in some cases, and (3) are capable of generating layouts with user-specified diversity measures.

  abstract: Multi-robot assembly systems are becoming increasingly appealing in manufacturing due to their ability to automatically, flexibly, and quickly construct desired structural designs. However, effectively planning for these systems in a manner that ensures each robot is simultaneously productive, and not idle, is challenging due to (1) the close proximity that the robots must operate in to manipulate the structure and (2) the inherent structural partial orderings on when each part can be installed. In this paper, we present a task and motion planning framework that jointly plans safe, low-makespan plans for a team of robots to assemble complex spatial structures. Our framework takes a hierarchical approach that, at the high level, uses Mixed-integer Linear Programs to compute an abstract plan comprised of an allocation of robots to tasks subject to precedence constraints and, at the low level, builds on a state-of-the-art algorithm for Multi-Agent Path Finding to plan collision-free robot motions that realize this abstract plan. Critical to our approach is the inclusion of certain collision constraints and movement durations during high-level planning, which better informs the search for abstract plans that are likely to be both feasible and low-makespan while keeping the search tractable. We demonstrate our planning system on several challenging assembly domains with several (sometimes heterogeneous) robots with grippers or suction plates for assembling structures with up to 23 objects involving Lego bricks, bars, plates, or irregularly shaped blocks.

  abstract: Robots performing tasks in warehouses provide the first example of wide-spread adoption of autonomous vehicles in transportation and logistics. The efficiency of these operations, which can vary widely in practice, are a key factor in the success of supply chains. In this work we consider the problem of coordinating a fleet of robots performing picking operations in a warehouse so as to maximize the net profit achieved within a time period while respecting problem- and robot-specific constraints. We formulate the problem as a weighted set packing problem where the elements in consideration are items on the warehouse floor that can be picked up and delivered within specified time windows. We enforce the constraint that robots must not collide, that each item is picked up and delivered by at most one robot, and that the number of robots active at any time does not exceed the total number available. Since the set of routes is exponential in the size of the input, we attack optimization of the resulting integer linear program using column generation, where pricing amounts to solving an elementary resource-constrained shortest-path problem. We propose an efficient optimization scheme that avoids consideration of every increment within the time windows. We also propose a heuristic pricing algorithm that can efficiently solve the pricing subproblem. While this itself is an important problem, the insights gained from solving these problems effectively can lead to new advances in other time-widow constrained vehicle routing problems.
